#CodeBook for CourseProject:

### (Instruction: Please submit a code book that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.) 

*variable1: SubjectID (directly derived from subject_test.txt & subject_train.txt)

*variable2: Activity (modified from y_test.txt & y_train.txt, given the information in activity_labels.txt)

*variable3-68: (Please also see My_VariableNameComparison.txt included in the repo for detailed side-by-side comparison) This is where the variable names (from features.txt) were transformed and made into more detailed descriptive variable names, primarily through spelling out the non-intuitive, abbreviated terms. For example: "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" is transformed into "Time_Body_Acceleration_Jerk_Mean_Xaxis".
